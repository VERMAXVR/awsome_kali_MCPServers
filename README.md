# awsome-kali-MCPServers

## Overview
Welcome to awsome-kali-MCPServers! This repository is a collection of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers designed specifically for Kali Linux environments. The goal is to enhance reverse engineering, security testing, and automation workflows by integrating powerful tools and flexible features. Whether you're a security researcher or a developer, this project aims to streamline your tasks with Kali Linux.

## What to Expect
Network Analysis: Tools for sniffing and analyzing traffic.
Binary Understanding: Support for reverse engineering and function analysis.
Automation: Scripts and servers to simplify repetitive tasks.

## TODO
- [ ] **Docker Sandbox Support**: Add containerized environments for safe testing and execution.
- [ ] **Network Tools Integration**: Support for tools like Nmap and Wireshark for advanced network analysis.
- [ ] **Reverse Engineering Tools**: Integrate Ghidra and Radare2 for enhanced binary analysis.
- [ ] **Agent Support**: Enable agent-based functionality for distributed tasks or remote operations.
 
## Current Status
This project is still in its early stages. I’m working on preparing the content, including server configurations, tool integrations, and documentation. Nothing is fully ready yet, but stay tuned—exciting things are coming soon!

## Stay Updated
Feel free to star or watch this repository to get updates as I add more features and files. Contributions and suggestions are welcome once the groundwork is laid out.
